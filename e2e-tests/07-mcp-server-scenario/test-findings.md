# MCP Server E2E Test Findings

## What's Working ✅
1. **MCP Server is running** and accessible on port 8080
2. **SSE parsing fix worked** - we can communicate with the server
3. **Server initializes with queries** - logs show it knows about `customer-data` and `order-data`
4. **Basic MCP protocol works** - initialization handshake succeeds

## What's Not Working ❌

### 1. Query Resources Not Exposed
- The server returns only a single `queries` collection resource
- When reading this collection, it returns `{"queries": []}`
- Individual query resources are not listed (expected `queries/customer-data`, `queries/order-data`)

### 2. Change Events Not Processed
- No logs showing change event handling
- Entries are not created when data is inserted
- The server responds with "Entry not found" errors

### 3. URI Mismatch
- Server logs show it's looking for entries
- But the resource store doesn't contain them
- Suggests change events from Drasi aren't being processed

## Root Causes

1. **MCP Resource Implementation Issue**
   - The server has queries configured internally
   - But the MCP resource API doesn't expose them correctly
   - The `ListQueries()` method might not be returning the configured queries

2. **Change Event Handler Not Working**
   - The reaction isn't receiving or processing change events from Drasi
   - This could be a Dapr pubsub configuration issue
   - Or the ChangeEventHandler implementation might have issues

3. **Resource URI Format**
   - The test expects hierarchical URIs but server might use different format
   - Need to verify the actual URI structure the server uses

## Recommendations

1. **Debug the MCP Server Implementation**
   - Check `DrasiResourceType.ListQueries()` method
   - Verify how queries are added to the resource list
   - Check if the resource store is properly initialized

2. **Verify Change Event Flow**
   - Check if the reaction is subscribed to the correct topics
   - Verify Dapr pubsub configuration
   - Add logging to ChangeEventHandler

3. **Simplify Test Expectations**
   - For now, test with the single `queries` resource
   - Don't expect individual query resources until implementation is fixed
